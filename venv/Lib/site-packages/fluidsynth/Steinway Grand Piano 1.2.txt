	    STEINWAY GRAND PIANO V1.2 (082800)


A 30MB Piano SoundFont.... By Soeren Bovbjerg...

It is sampled from a Steinway Grand Piano model C. All the white keys
are sampled three times (since I hardly ever use the black ones). 
More layers are created in Vienna to create an illusionof more samples 
(since it is in SF2 format.... damn you Creative we want SF2.1 support 
on SBLive! Let's see what the APS drivers will bring...........)

This is the first release of this soundfont, but I think it nearly
as good as it gets. The worst problem is velocity. It is balanced so it
will sound nice on my Ensoniq KS-32 (weighted keys). So it might not fit
your own keyboard. That is easy fixed: Open the Soundfont in vienna, and
adjust the velocity layers ;-)

Remember: A little reverb always helps......


ENJOY!
