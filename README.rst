createMidiDataset

This project tries to create an artificial annotated dataset of MIDI files for the following musical elements:

- Single notes (all 88 notes) with different with randomized lengths, strengths, durations, instruments, etc.
- All Major, Minor and Diminished triads in no-inversion form, in different octaves.

In the future I might add other chords like tetrads (dominant, Maj7, Min7, MajMin7, Diminished, HalfDiminished, etc.), inversions, two hands chords, extensions, etc.
