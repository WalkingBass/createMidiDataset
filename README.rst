createMidiDataset

This project tries to create an artificial annotated dataset of MIDI files for the following musical elements:

- Single notes (all 88 notes) with different with randomized lengths, strengths, durations, instruments, etc.
- All Major, Minor and Diminished triads in no-inversion form, in different octaves.

In the future I might add other chords like tetrads (dominant, Maj7, Min7, MajMin7, Diminished, HalfDiminished, etc.), inversions, two hands chords, extensions, etc.

This project needs a soundfont file named 'FluidR3_GM.SF2' in folder /createMidiDataset/util/sound_fonts/'. Due to the size of the soundfont file I am using I have not been able to include it in the repository. You can find the file I am using in https://member.keymusician.com/Member/FluidR3_GM/index.html
